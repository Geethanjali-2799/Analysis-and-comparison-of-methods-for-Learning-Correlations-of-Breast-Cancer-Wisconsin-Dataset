Me along with my teammates worked on this project to compare various machine learning algorithms to classify the Brest Cancer Wisconsin dataset from the UCI Machine Learning repository. To achieve this goal, we first preprocessed the data to remove any obvious outliers or data points without complete information. Next, we performed exploratory data analysis to find the statistical distribution of data. Then, we performed principal component analysis (PCA) to find out correlation among different features. Next, we trained three classifiers to identify the cancer. Finally, we evaluated the performance of each technique and analyze efficacy of these algorithms.
